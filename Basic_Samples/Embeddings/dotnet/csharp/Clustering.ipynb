I've made and drank two batches of the tea ( each makes four 8-oz cups) and I assume all the health-giving properties are doing their thing!  The tea itself is bland and pretty tasteless.  I drink it icy cold and it's like drinking water - no better, no worse.  People can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also, but I just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what I prefer.  It's a health drink and I can't imagine anyone disliking it, and that's the main thing.  You don't have to hold your nose and choke it down.  It's fine.\r\n",

That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.\r\n",

It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal.\r\n",
